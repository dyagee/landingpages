# landingpages
This repo is for all the amazing landing pages I have worked on

***************************************************************************************************************
The xx.main.css used for most of the projects is general customization I use for most of my pages,
It has some predefined properties for dynamism and a lot other functionalities that one don't have to start coding all over again. So link the corresponding xx.main.css file, and for any adjustments you can create in-page styling or another stylesheet for that purpose.
